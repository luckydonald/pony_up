# PonyUp!
###### Version `0.1.1`
Migrations for ponyorm

## Very simple migrations.

### Install

This still a first beta version, but you can test it already with the following shell command:
```sh
$ pip install pony_up
```

### Getting started

```python
from pony_up import migrate

# to be able to bind the database with your information,
# just create a function for it:
def bind_func(db):
    db.bind('database type', host='localhost', user='root', passwd='1234secure', db='test1')
    # https://docs.ponyorm.com/api_reference.html#Database.bind
    db.generate_mapping(create_tables=True)
    # https://docs.ponyorm.com/api_reference.html#Database.generate_mapping
# end def


db = migrate(bind_func, folder_path="examples/migrations, python_import="examples.migrations")
```
> In case the import in line 1 does not work, see [#1](https://github.com/luckydonald/pony_up/issues/1#issuecomment-448175018) for a workaround.

The updates are applied as soon as `migrate` is called. It will return `db`, being the latest schema.

### Your File schema
- `migrations/`: The migrations are in here
    - `v{number}/`: for example "v0"
        - `__init__.py`: needs to import the model and also migrate if present.
        - `model.py`: model of version `{number}`
        - `migrate.py`: the script which updates from the model in this folder (`{number}`) to the next version (`{number+1}`).
    - `v{number}.py`:    
        A file is possible too, if it has the attribute `model` with a function `register_database` (calling `model.register_database(db)`)    
        and optionally a `migrate` attribute with function `do_update` (it will call `migrate.do_update(db)`).
        
    However use only one of those, either the folder or the single file.

### The required functions

###### `model.py`

```python
def register_database(db):
```         
> In this function should be your `orm.Entity` subclasses.

Arguments:
- `db` - The database to register entities to.

###### `migrate.py`

```python
def do_update(db, old_db=None):
```
> Here you write code which changes stuff in the database
 
Arguments:
- `db` - The latest schema. 
- `old_db` - This can have 3 different types:   
    - `pony.orm.Database` A database schema of the previous migration step (Would be **v0** if we are at **v1**. See _Fig 1_),    
    - `True` if the provided `db` database is old, and this version didn't introduced a new schema. (See **v2** in _Fig 1_)    
    - `None` if there was no previous step (The first migration, e.g. **v0**)

#### How to use

#### I don't like using `db.{EntityName}`.
Before I have used the file `database.py`, to include all my objects,
and still like to use the existing import statements. I imported it like the following:
```python
from database import {EntityName}
```
or I have imported all the database entities with the wildcard import like:
```python
from database import *
```

> You should move the entity definitions in `database.py` into a migrations step (`v0.model` perhaps),
> and replace the file content with `db = migrate(...)`, like seen above.    
> Now you can add the following lines after said `db = migrate(...)` part:    
> ```python
> # register the tables to this module
> __all__ = ["db"]
> for t_name, t_clazz in db.entities.items():
>     globals()[t_name] = t_clazz
>     __all__.append(t_name)
> # end for
> ```

#### My application with the migration will run multible times at the same time.
> You need to deploy some sort of locking, because else two clients trying to modify the same tables would end in a disaster.    
> If you use postgres, you can use [Advisory Locks](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS). (Also see this [blog post with examples](https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/advisory-locks-in-postgres)).    
> Request a lock before the `db = migrate(...)`, and release it afterwards:
> ```python
> import psycopg2
> con = psycopg2.connect(host=POSTGRES_HOST, user=POSTGRES_USER, password=POSTGRES_PASSWORD, database=POSTGRES_DB)
> cur = con.cursor()
> # requesting database update lock
> cur.execute("SELECT pg_advisory_lock(85,80);")  # update lock (ascii: 85,80 = UP)
> 
>
> # run the migration
> db = migrate(...)
> 
> 
> # releasing lock after database update
> cur.execute("SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(85,80);")  # update lock (ascii: 85,80 = UP)
> res = cur.fetchone()
> if not isinstance(res[0], bool) or not res[0]:
>     # True = success
>     # Fail => false or no bool
>     raise ValueError("Could not release update lock, lock was not held (Advisory Lock 85,80)")
> # end if
> ```
  
#### I like the script above, but it should just terminate instead of waiting,

> Replace the `cur.execute("SELECT pg_advisory_lock(85,80);")` part above with: 
> ```python
> # requesting database update lock
> cur.execute("SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock(85,80);")  # update lock (ascii: 85,80 = UP)
> res = cur.fetchone()
> if not isinstance(res[0], bool) or not res[0]:
>     # True = success
>     # Fail => false or no bool
>     raise ValueError("Currently already upgrading. (Advisory Lock 85,80)")
> # end if
> ```
> With that your script will raise an exception (and probably terminate) if the database is already being upgraded somewhere else.    
> Note: in a webserver (flask, django, ...) environment this is probably not wanted.
> Like, a Nginx server would keep running, and uWSGI would spam the log with `no python application found, check your startup logs for errors`.

#### Where does the name come from?
> Because of the library `Pony ORM`, and this tool doing `updates`!    
> Got it? Yeah, what a sick joke! Tell your Grandma, too!
> Also there is the verb `to pony up`, which is not really related.

#### Who is best pony?
> Definitely **Littlepip**! (see [Fallout: Equestria](http://falloutequestria.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout:_Equestria))
